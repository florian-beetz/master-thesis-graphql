# Master Thesis Case Study -- REST Microservice

This repository contains a small sample project I am developing as a part of my
[Master Thesis](https://cloud.florianbeetz.de/s/6pbS45PAQxt7ep4/download).
The goal of the master thesis is to evaluate architectural differences of microservice architectures when using REST or
GraphQL as API models.

This repository contains the GraphQL implementation of the case study.

## Architecture Overview

This example project models a small online shop. 
The architecture consists of four microservices, responsible for processing orders, managing inventory, processing
payments, and shipping.
